        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Super delicious Muffins free of grains and dairy. </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>4 Eggs</li>
                <li>60g sugar or other sweetener of choice</li>
                <li>70 ml of unsweetened milk alternative of choice (I'm using coconut-rice-drink)</li>
                <li>70 g molten cokonut oil</li>
                <li>300 g ground almonds </li>
                <li>200 g raspberries or cherries (frozen produkts work just fine after defrosting)</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 180C. Line a 12 hole muffin pan with muffin paper or grease with an oil spray if preferred. Set aside.</li>
                <li>In a medium size mixing bowl whisk together eggs, sweetener of your choice, your milk alternative and melted coconut oil. Make sure all the ingredients are at room temperature. If you are using cold eggs straight out from the fridge they will solidify the coconut oil creating oil lumps. Otherwise, use butter to avoid this to happen.</li>
                <li>Stir in ground almonds, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring between to gently incorporate the almonds to avoid lumps.</li>
                <li>Stir in raspberries or cherries (when using frosen fruits, let them drain well as that avoids a batter thats too moist). </li>
                <li>Transfer batter to the prepered cases</li>
                <li>Bake for 22-25 min.</li>
                <li>Let them cool for 10 min before removing them from the muffin pan. Then let them cool for another hour befor eating.</li>
            </ol>
